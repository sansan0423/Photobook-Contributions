# Bitbucket Contributions Log

**Internship Activity at Photobook Malaysia**

This repository serves as a daily log of commit activity and coding tasks completed during my internship at **Photobook Malaysia**. While all development work is done in a private Bitbucket repository, this log keeps track of contributions and progress in a transparent, public way.

## 📅 Purpose

- Keep a visible record of coding activity
- Maintain an active GitHub contribution graph
- Respect company confidentiality (no source code shared)

## 🛠️ What’s Logged

- Number of commits per day
- General description of tasks (e.g. bug fixes, feature development)
- No private or sensitive code is included

## 🔒 Notes

All actual code resides in a private Bitbucket repository and is the property of Photobook Malaysia. This repo contains **only public logs** of activity and does not expose any proprietary content
